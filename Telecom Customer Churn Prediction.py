Univariate analysis

The univariate analysis shows that the distribution of the numerical features is not normal. For example, the distribution of the customer_tenure feature is skewed to the right, meaning that there are more customers with shorter tenure than customers with longer tenure. This information can be used to transform the features before building a machine learning model.

Bivariate analysis

The correlation matrix shows that there are strong correlations between some of the features. For example, there is a strong positive correlation between the customer_tenure feature and the customer_monthly_charges feature. This means that customers with longer tenure are more likely to have higher monthly charges. This information can be used to select the most important features for building a machine learning model.

Multivariate analysis

The principal component analysis (PCA) shows that the first two principal components explain a significant amount of the variance in the data. This means that the first two principal components can be used to represent the data in a lower-dimensional space. This can be useful for building a machine learning model, as it can reduce the computational complexity of the model.

Conclusion

The data cleansing and EDA steps above have helped us to clean and explore the data. We have identified the most important features (customer tenure, customer monthly charges) and identified any correlations between the features (strong positive correlation between customer tenure and customer monthly charges). This information can be used to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn.

Here are some additional comments on the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis:

Univariate analysis: We can also use the univariate analysis to identify any outliers in the data. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. They can be caused by errors in data collection or entry, or they can be genuine data points that are simply very different from the norm. It is important to identify outliers, as they can have a significant impact on the results of machine learning models.
Bivariate analysis: We can also use the correlation matrix to identify any negative correlations between the features. Negative correlations indicate that two features are inversely related, meaning that an increase in one feature is associated with a decrease in the other feature. This information can be used to build more accurate machine learning models.
Multivariate analysis: We can also use PCA to identify the most important features for building a machine learning model. The features with the highest loadings on the first few principal components are the most important features, as they explain the most variance in the data.
Overall, the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis have provided us with valuable insights into the data. This information can be used to build a more accurate and efficient machine learning model to predict customer churn.

# Drop any redundant columns
df = df.drop(['customer_id'], axis=1)

'''
The customer_id column is a redundant column for customer churn prediction because it does not contain any information about the customer's behavior or characteristics. The customer_id column is simply a unique identifier for each customer.

Customer churn prediction models are typically trained on data that contains information about the customer's behavior and characteristics, such as:

Customer tenure
Customer monthly charges
Customer total charges
Customer type
Customer age
Customer gender
Customer usage patterns
The model uses this information to learn the relationship between the customer's behavior and characteristics and the likelihood that the customer will churn.

The customer_id column does not contain any information about the customer's behavior or characteristics. Therefore, it is not useful for training a customer churn prediction model.

In fact, the customer_id column can actually be harmful for training a customer churn prediction model. This is because the model can learn to predict the customer's churn decision based on the customer_id, rather than the customer's behavior and characteristics. This can lead to overfitting, which is when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the unseen test data.

Therefore, it is generally recommended to drop the customer_id column before training a customer churn prediction model.

# Standardize the columns using z-score scaling approach

'''
This code will split the dataset into two parts, a training set and a test set, with a 70:30 ratio. It will then standardize the columns in the training and test sets using the z-score scaling approach.

The z-score scaling approach is a common method for standardizing data. It works by subtracting the mean from each value and then dividing by the standard deviation. This results in a new set of values with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

Z-score scaling is a useful technique for preparing data for machine learning models because it can help to improve the performance of the models. This is because it puts all of the features on the same scale, which makes it easier for the models to learn the relationships between the features.

The logistic regression model is the best trained model, with the highest test accuracy. Logistic regression is a good choice for classification problems because it is simple to interpret and can be effective on a variety of datasets. Additionally, logistic regression is relatively robust to outliers and can be used on both linear and non-linear datasets.
'''
'''
In conclusion, we have performed data cleansing, exploratory data analysis, and data preparation for customer churn prediction. We have also trained and tested three machine learning models: logistic regression, KNN, and Naive Bayes. The logistic regression model has the highest test accuracy, so it is the best trained model.

We can improve the accuracy of the customer churn prediction model by:

Using more features in the model. For example, we could include features such as customer satisfaction, customer usage patterns, and customer demographics.
Using a different machine learning model. For example, we could try using a random forest or gradient boosting model.
Tuning the hyperparameters of the machine learning model. For example, we could try adjusting the number of trees in a random forest model or the learning rate in a gradient boosting model.
Using a larger dataset. The more data we have, the better the model will be able to learn the patterns that are associated with customer churn.
We can also use the customer churn prediction model to identify customers who are at risk of churning. Once we have identified these customers, we can take steps to retain them, such as offering them discounts or special promotions.
